# CSV-Based Data Configuration

This POC uses CSV files instead of a database for simplicity. All data is stored in the `backend/data/` directory.

## CSV Files

- `users.csv` - User profiles
- `user_preferences.csv` - User notification and geo-location preferences
- `transactions.csv` - Transaction history (following the Transaction History Schema)
- `rewards.csv` - Available rewards and Priceless experiences

## Transaction History Schema

The `transactions.csv` file follows this exact schema:

- **Date Time Fields**: Posted (by FI) and Transaction date/time fields available.
- **Customer ID**: A number generated by MA Open Banking that uniquely identifies a customer.
- **Account ID**: A number generated by MA Open Banking that uniquely identifies a customer's account: checking, savings, etc.
- **Description + Memo**: Two free text fields, often concatenated by data science, that offer information on merchant, payment processor, geographic location, and transaction type (P2P, P2M, Income, etc).
- **Value Amount**: In USD.

## Adding New Data

To add new transactions, users, or rewards:

1. Edit the appropriate CSV file in `backend/data/`
2. Restart the backend server
3. The CSV loader will automatically read the updated data

## CSV Format

All CSV files use:
- UTF-8 encoding
- Comma-separated values
- Header row with column names
- ISO 8601 datetime format (e.g., `2024-01-15T10:30:00`)

## Notes

- The CSV loader reads data on every request (no caching for POC simplicity)
- Updates to preferences via API are in-memory only (not persisted to CSV)
- For production, consider migrating to a proper database
